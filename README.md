# Movie-recommendation-lab
UMass STAT535 Project - Movie recommendation

## Milestones
- November 14th
 - Second dataset ready
 - Look at scikit learn template
 - Start master tree in github
 
 - After Thanksgiving
   - Preprocessing
     - Missing Values
     - Outliers
     - Standardized variable names
     - Encode qualitative / categorical variables
     - Data Reduction: Variable selection

   - Classifiers to start with: 
     - Decision Trees (Random Forest) (Scott)
     - SVM (Sixtus)
     - Gaussian Naive Bayes (Tobi)




## Scicit-learn template
Our class should look like that and implement the same methods (fit, predict)

## Possible Second data sets
- German credit data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)

##### Patrick's comments 11/9

- Goal: Build a small real world deployment pipeline like it can be used in netflix / amazon 
- build / test with movie recommendation data set (model fitting, data preprocessing, evaluation)
- Show that it also works with another dataset like product recommendation
 - Find data on UCI repo, kaggle, google search 

- Use scikit learn estimation: https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/project-template
