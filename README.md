##### Patrick's comments 11/9

- Goal: Build a small real world deployment pipeline like it can be used in netflix / amazon 
- build / test with movie recommendation data set (model fitting, data preprocessing, evaluation)
- Show that it also works with another dataset like product recommendation
 - Find data on UCI repo, kaggle, google search 

- Use scikit learn estimation: https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/project-template
