##### Abstract
We present a hybrid recommender system for movie recommendation. Our system combines the strenghts of three common recommendation algorithms - Random forest classification, content-based filtering, and collaborative filtering. The algorithms are deployed based on the quality of the user profile to recommend movies for . This enables optimal recommendation for different user groups. The combined recommender system is implemented in a python class with a fit and predict method, in the style of a scikit-learn template. While random-forest prediction and collaborative filtering performed fairly well, content-based evaluation is not possible because of sparse data and missing user feedback, which makes an evaluation of the combined system not possible.
